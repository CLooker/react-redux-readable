# Quickstart

If you haven't installed node, you need to do that, first.

Next, you will need to clone two repositories.

The first one is the <a href="https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter">api server</a>

The second one is this one.

The directions for both are the same. Clone each one, and using your favorite shell terminal, navigate to the respective installation directory.

Type `yarn` or `npm install`.

To start the api server, you will need to type `node server` while in the root directory.

Next, in the root directory for this repository, type `yarn start` or `npm start`. This should launch a new tab in a browser window.

# Context

This was the second project for the Udacity React Nanodegree program. It's basically a message board built with React and Redux.
