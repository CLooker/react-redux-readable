# Super Quickstart

Just go to the <a href="https://clooker.github.io/react-redux-readable/">deployed site.</a>

# Local Deployment

If you haven't installed node, you need to do that, first.

Then, clone this repository and using your favorite shell terminal, navigate to the respective installation directory.

Type `yarn` or `npm install`.

When that finishes, type `yarn start` or `npm start`. This should launch a new tab in a browser window.

# Context

This was the second project for the Udacity React Nanodegree program. It's basically a message board built with React and Redux.

I did not write the <a href="https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter">api server</a>, though I did deploy a forked version of it.
